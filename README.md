This is the final project of _Code First: Girls x Coding Kickstarter - (Remote) Introduction to Data and SQL Programming_. Our goal is to create a relational music database that contains with minimum 8 tables.

### Minimum tasks include:

- [x]Create relational DB of your choice with minimum 8 tables

- [x]Set Primary and Foreign Key constraints to create relations between the tables

- [x]Using any type of the joins create a view that combines multiple tables in a logical way

- [x]In your database, create a stored function that can be applied to a query in your DB

- [x]Prepare an example query with a subquery to demonstrate how to extract data from your DB for analysis

- [x]Create DB diagram where all table relations are shown


### Some advanced options:

- [x]In your database, create a stored procedure and demonstrate how it runs

- [x]In your database, create a trigger and demonstrate how it runs

- [x]In your database, create an event and demonstrate how it runs

- [x]Create a view that uses at least 3-4 base tables; prepare and demonstrate a query that uses the view to produce a logically arranged result set for analysis.
